Step 1: Understand the Requirements
Break down the requirements:
Input from Google Sheets/CSV.
Email account connection (via OAuth2/SMTP/ESP).
Customizable prompts and dynamic field replacements.
Email customization, sending, and scheduling.
Real-time analytics and dashboard.
ESP integration for delivery tracking.
Step 2: Plan the Tech Stack
Front-end Framework: React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Back-end Framework: Flask, Django, FastAPI, or Node.js.
Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase for scheduling and analytics.
Libraries:
Email API: SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES.
Google Sheets API for data fetching.
OAuth2 libraries for secure email integration.
Task Queue: Celery (with Redis) or Python schedule module for scheduling emails.
LLM API: OpenAI, Cohere, or Groq for email content generation.
Real-time Updates: WebSockets or polling with libraries like Socket.IO.
Step 3: Set Up the Environment
Initialize a GitHub repository for version control.
Set up the development environment:
Install required dependencies.
Use virtual environments or Docker for project isolation.
Step 4: Build the Features
Feature 1: Data Connection
Create options to upload a CSV file or connect to Google Sheets using the Sheets API.
Parse and validate the uploaded file to extract columns dynamically.
Feature 2: Email Account Integration
Use OAuth2 for secure Gmail/Outlook connections.
Add SMTP configurations for custom ESP connections (like SendGrid).
Feature 3: Prompt Customization and Field Replacement
Implement a text input box for customizable prompts.
Parse the prompt for placeholders (e.g., {Company Name}).
Replace placeholders with actual data from the uploaded file.
Feature 4: Email Sending
Use LLM APIs to generate customized content for each email.
Integrate email APIs (SendGrid, Mailgun, or SES) for sending.
Handle email sending in batches for throttling.
Feature 5: Scheduling and Throttling
Store email schedules in the database.
Use a task scheduler (Celery or schedule) to trigger emails at specified times.
Add rate-limiting logic to comply with ESP rules.
Feature 6: Analytics and Tracking
Use the chosen ESPâ€™s API/webhooks to track delivery and open rates.
Store analytics data in the database.
Update the dashboard in real-time using WebSockets or regular polling.
Feature 7: Real-time Dashboard
Build a front-end interface to show:
Status: Sent, Scheduled, Failed, etc.
Analytics: Open rate, bounce rate, etc.
Use data visualization libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for metrics.
Step 5: Testing
Unit Testing: Test individual components (email sending, scheduling).
Integration Testing: Test the complete workflow from data input to analytics.
User Testing: Simulate real-world use cases (e.g., bulk emails, high-load scenarios).
